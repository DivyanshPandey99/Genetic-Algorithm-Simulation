# Genetic Algorithm Simulation

This project is a simulation of a genetic algorithm using the Pygame library in Python. The simulation consists of various objects such as preys, predators, food, and poison. The DNA of the preys and predators is used to determine their fitness for survival, which is the main objective of the genetic algorithm.

Has Preys, Predators, Food, Poison as objects.

The DNA and and the fight for food and survival makes the fitness function for the Genetic algorithm.

Cloning/Repproduction of Preys and Predators, involves probabilistic approach, and has mutation.

## Objects in the Simulation

### Preys

Preys are the main targets of the predators in the simulation. They are randomly placed in the environment and move around in search of food. The preys are represented by blue circles.

### Predators

Predators are the hunters in the simulation. Their main objective is to hunt the preys for survival. Predators are represented by red circles.

### Food

Food is an essential object in the simulation, as it provides sustenance for the preys. The food objects are represented by green circles.

### Poison

Poison is a harmful object in the simulation that reduces the health of the preys. The poison objects are represented by red circles.

### DNA and Fitness Function

The DNA and health of the preys and predators is used to determine their fitness for survival. The DNA is a set of genes that determines various traits such as speed, perception of food, poison, preys or predators. 

### Cloning/Reproduction
Cloning or reproduction in the simulation involves a probabilistic approach, where the DNA of the parent is randomly mutated to produce a new offspring. This approach ensures genetic diversity and helps to improve the fitness of the population over time.

## Why Pygame?
Pygame is a powerful library for creating games and simulations in Python. It provides a simple and easy-to-use interface for creating graphical environments and handling user input. Pygame is ideal for this simulation as it provides a simple way to create the graphical objects and handle the physics and collisions between them.


## Conclusion

In conclusion, the simulation of a genetic algorithm using Pygame provides an excellent way to learn about genetic algorithms and their applications in real-world scenarios. The simulation is interactive and provides a hands-on way to explore the concepts of DNA, fitness function, and cloning in genetic algorithms.
