# Genetic-Algorithm-Simulation

Created Simulation of Genetic Algorithm, using Pygame, and Python.

Has Preys, Predators, Food, Poison as objects.

DNA of Preys, and Predators, makes the fitness function for Genetic algorithm.

Cloning/Repproduction of Preys and Predators, involves probabilistic approach, and has mutation.
